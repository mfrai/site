  <div id="description">
    <p> Iâ€™m Maya, a sophomore at Cornell studying Computer and Information Science. On campus, I am involved with <a href="https://wicc.acm.org/">Women in Computing at Cornell </a>as a Vice President, co-founder of <a href="http://bkyd.community/">BKYD</a>, a new community program to help students launch their own side projects, and a designer and iOS instructor on <a href="https://www.cornellappdev.com/">CUAppDev</a>. <br/> <br/>
    I love to manage my own side projects, one of which is a platform I recently built called <a href="http://letshearit.webflow.io/">Let's Hear It</a>, where I share stories about women from various industries on gender diversity and female empowerment.
    <br/> <br/>
    This past winter, I was working at <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/">Rent the Runway</a> as a product management intern and this summer, I am working as a product design intern at <a href="https://facebook.design/">Facebook</a> on the Pages Business Platform team.
    <br/> <br/>
    I have always been someone who takes the lead, able to be thrown into something, learn quickly, and develop potential strategies to achieve visionary objectives. I am incredibly passionate about building products, motivating teams, and thinking creatively.
    <br/> <br/>
    Feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk about my work. :)
